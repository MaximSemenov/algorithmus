# Algorithmus

Algorithmus is a small Angular app that collects and displays the most of JavaScript algorithms, problems tasks and issues I have collected on my computer since January 2017. It has smple navigation and structure.  The cool think is it contains a Node script that picks all .js files from your local directory and generates a JSON file with Base64 binary-to-text encoding scheme. Also it has a nice little feature to test code performance! Try it out.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
